# LangGraph: Build Stateful AI Agents in Python

This repo contains the source code for [LangGraph: Build Stateful AI Agents in Python](https://realpython.com/langgraph-build-stateful-ai-agents-in-python/)

## Setup

Create a new virtual environment, and run the following command to install LangGraph and the additional requirements for this project:

```console
(venv) $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You'll use `langchain-openai` to interact with OpenAI LLMs, but keep in mind you can use any LLM provider you like with LangGraph and LangChain. You'll use [`pydantic`](https://realpython.com/python-pydantic/) to validate the information your agent parses from emails.

Before moving forward, if you choose to use OpenAI, make sure you're signed up for an OpenAI account and you have a valid [API key](https://openai.com/api/). You'll need to set the following [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) before running any examples in this tutorial:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY>
```

## Usage

TODO: A short note on how to run the project. You can tell them to go to the tutorial for more information.
