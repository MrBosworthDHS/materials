The materials contained in this download are designed to complement the Real Python tutorial [Marimo: A Reactive, Reproducible Notebook](https://realpython.com/marimo-notebook-reactive-reproducible/).

You should create a new folder named marimo on your computer and place each of these files inside it. You might also consider creating a [Python virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) within this folder.

Your download bundle contains the following files:

hypotenuse_calculator.py                      - This file contains the original hypotenuse_calculator code
hypotenuse_calculator_before_update.py        - This file contains the code before any updating is attempted.  The code has been deliberately placed out of order, however it runs cleanly.
hypotenuse_calculator_duplicate_variable.py   - This file shows the effect of re-defining a variable. This file produces an error.
hypotenuse_calculator_after_update.py         - This file contains the code after the `adjacent` variable was updated to `10`. This file runs cleanly.
hypotenuse_calculator_after_deletion.py       - This file contains the code after the `opposite variable` was deleted. This file produces an error.

break_even_analysis_chart_code.py             - This file contains the basic chart code.  It will produce a break-even analysis for a fixed set of input data.
break_even_analysis_UI_elements.py            - This file contains includes the four UI interface elements to allow the plot to be adjusted. 
break_even_analysis_solution.py               - This file contains a possible solution to the skills test. 

packages.py    - This file contains the code used to demonstrate sandboxing.
quadratic.py   - This file contains the marimo notebook version of the quadratic formula example.
equation.py    - This file contains the Python script version of quadratic.py.

simultaneous_equations.py     - This file contains the code used to demonstrate marimo's UI elements.
simultaneous_equations_ui.py  - This file contains a possible solution to the challenge skills test.

hidden_state.ipynb - This file contains a Jupyter Notebook that can be used as a starting point for the investigation of its problems. You should adjust it as instructed in the tutorial.
