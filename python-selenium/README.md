# Modern Web Automation With Python and Selenium

This repository contains the module `bandcamp`, which is the sample app built in the Real Python tutorial [Modern Web Automation With Python and Selenium](https://realpython.com/modern-web-automation-with-python-and-selenium/).

## Installation and Setup

Create and activate a [Python virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).

Then, install the requirements:

```sh
(venv) $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The only direct dependency for this project is [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/). You should use a Python version of at least 3.10, which is necessary to support [structural pattern matching](https://realpython.com/structural-pattern-matching/).

You'll need a [Firefox Selenium driver](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers) called `geckodriver` to run the project as-is. Make sure to [download and install](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) it before running the project.

## Run the Bandcamp Discover Player

To run the music player, install the package, then use the entry point command from your command-line:

```sh
(venv) $ python -m pip install .
(venv) $ bandcamp-player
```

You'll see a text-based user interface that allows you to interact with the music player:

```
Type: play [<track_number>] | pause | tracks | more | exit
>
```

Type one of the available commands to interact with Bandcamp's Discover section through your headless browser. Listen to songs with `play`, list available tracks with `tracks`, and load more songs using `more`. You can exit the music player by typing `exit`.
